<H1>SCARY STORIES</H1>
<H2>Brownies</H1>
<p>“Hey,” Jacob said, swinging his feet back and forth over the armrest of the couch he was flopped across. “What’s in these brownies again?”</p>
<p>“Weed, dumbass,” said Riley. He really needed to stop selling to this guy.</p>
<p>“Weed?” Jacob repeated. “I don’t know, man. This is like, wiggly.” He snorted. “Wiggly weed.”</p>
<p>Riley rolled his eyes. He hated babysitting stoned people, and Jacob was one of the worst. But he paid stupidly well, and he’d take whatever you gave him, even the sketchy shit Riley bought online. And he always shared.</p>
<p>“Are you sure it was weed?” Jacob whined. He looked like he was going to cry.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s weed,” said Riley tiredly. “Edibles hit a little harder, I told you.”</p>
<p>“But it’s--” Jacob gasped, and Riley turned to look at him. His face was pale and beginning to sweat. “It’s moving.”</p>
<p>“Are you gonna puke?” Riley looked frantically around his room for some kind of vomit receptacle.</p>
<p>“I dunno.” Jacob was breathing heavily now, and slurring his words. Riley finally grabbed a bowl, just as he hacked up a thin stream of vomit. Great. At least it hadn’t gotten on the couch. Jacob turned to Riley, his eyes wide and shiny, his mouth wet. “I think I’m getting sick.”</p>
<p>“This is normal for your first time,” Riley lied. He wasn’t sure if he could take Jacob to the hospital. The university had an amnesty policy when it came to drugs, but everybody knew that was bullshit. Maybe he could just throw Jacob into the path of an ambulance and run.</p>
<p>“Gonna throw up again,” muttered Jacob.</p>
<p>“Jesus.” Riley heaved him up by his shoulders. “Into the bowl.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.” Jacob ducked his head over the bowl, his breath ragged and wet-sounding. Riley dove away as he hacked up a massive clump of what looked like bloody spaghetti.</p>
<p>“What did you eat?” asked Riley.</p>
<p>“Mmphh!” yelled Jacob. Riley looked up to see that Jacob’s mouth was somehow still stretched open with his own stringy vomit, and that the vomit was squirming. It wriggled its way out of the bowl and then began to wrap itself around Jacob’s face. “Mmphh!” he yelled again.</p>
<p>"Okay,” said Riley slowly. “Stay calm.”</p>
<p>Jacob gave another muffled scream, louder this time, and then his eyes began to bleed.</p>
<p>Riley scrambled to stand up. “I’ll get help.”</p>
<p>Jacob ignored him. The thin tentacles of vomit had wrapped themselves completely around his head, mummifying it. As Riley watched, they began to squeeze.</p>
<p>Riley ran, the pounding of his footsteps unable to drown out the sound of crunching bone from behind him. He slammed the door to his room and leaned gasping against it, trying not to panic. Jacob was dead, there was no point helping him. He just had to keep that thing from escaping.</p>
<p>Something moved in the pit of his stomach. Damn, Riley thought as it began to squirm up his throat, I really gotta get a better source.</p>
